/*:
 In our next class, we'll look at how to implement the actual bitmap encoding method we tried out on paper earlier this year.
 
 For the rest of this class (and for homework if necessary) consider the following encoding:
 
 ![encoding](encoding.png "png")
 
 First: decode this on paper.
 
 Next: think carefully about how you actually performed the decoding.
 
 What decisions did you make?
 
 List the decisions you made in as much detail as possible.
 
 This will help you make a plan for the program we will write in Swift in our next class.
