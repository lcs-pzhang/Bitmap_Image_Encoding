 ## For ... in ... loops
 So from our last page, we have a *string* (that's programmer speak for "a piece of text").
 
 The string is composed of 1's and 0's.
 
 Below, a special type of loop is used.
 
 Run this playground several times.
 
 What do you notice about how this loop operates?
 
 What is *different* compared to our usual *for i in stride(...* type of loop?
 
 What is the *same*?
 
 Be specific.
 
 Type your answer in the code comment.

// Get the encoded bitmap string
let encodedBitmap = getEncodedBitmapString()

// Loop
for character in encodedBitmap {
    print(character)
}

// I notice that... the number of times of it being looped are different each time.

// The number string is always different

// The characters are only 1s and 0s.
